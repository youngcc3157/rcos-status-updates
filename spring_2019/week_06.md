## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I finished creating our simple database about rooms and logs. I've pushed commits to 'database' and created pull request to be pulled to 'dev'. I've been also learning how to use Github properly again. We've been trying to use Gitflow development technique so that we don't make a mistake that cannot be revertable. I've been informing my team about the Gitflow and try to get them implement them on our developement. It has been working pretty good. We do need to work on implementation on using issue tab on Github though.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will create script that will create fixed room data in our database when our database is migrated. Also, I need to create a documentation on how to use create a database system like ours when other developers plan on integrate our code to their building/campus. Creating such documents is very important so that other developers will not need to ask questions on how to properly set up our system on their development space. Also, it is a great practice to become a good developer.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.
