## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I've been working on commenting our code and improving the quality of our code. There are few things that I mainly worked on such as commenting, changing poor variable names, and refactoring the code.Since we've mainly focused on meeting the deadline and completing the project on time, we definitly did not focus on creating a good-quality software. Now, our code is getting improved and anyone who will look at our code for the first time won't have to ask much of questions because it will be all written on our Github repository.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will finish up improving our codebase. Also, I'd like to touch upon documentation in general as well. It includes documenting how to set up our system on local machines and also how other developers can integrate our code and cater it to their own building/campus. Also, we have not really used Issue tab on Github but I do believe that it is an eifficent way to keep track of our progress as well as knowing what to work on. So, I will try to get this tab going.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Lack of time for working on project due to other stuff.

## Notes

> None
