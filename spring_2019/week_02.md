## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I've finshed on learning Django for tutorials and we discussed further about \
> the system structure for the whole project. The team is divided into two groups: hardware and software. I will be in software side working on Database systems and backend enhancement. Currently, I've learned about Django and re-learning Python coding since it has been awhile since last time I've used Python.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will be working on learning further features of Django such as Views, models, PostgreSQL on Django and such. I've schemed thruough most of the documentation but I still need to practice actual implementation. Also, I will be working on learning more Python syntax by doing some of leetcode questions. I will also need to learn about Github commands as well since we will implement Gitflow approach for our development.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Lack of knowledge for Django and python development still would be the biggest blocking element.

## Notes

> None
