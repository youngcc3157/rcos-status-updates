## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I've created Django script that creates tables within our PostgreSQL database. I pushed the commit to my own branch "database" from "dev". Now, the database will be used for testing/development. Since we don't necessarily need a lot of information for now, the table is very simple. However, I've designed it expandable so whenever we'd need to add more functionalities, it won't be too difficult.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will finish building our database with more pre-determined data models. Possibly start working on stat class again. The stat class has not been implemented since it is not really our main priority. It is a great functioanlity for RPI library to take advantage of (such as how long does an average RPI student spend time in a study room? and etc). However, there are many other functions that need to be implemented so I will probably get back to it as soon as possible.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I've spend most of my time thinking about scaliablity of the Data models and design it so that it won't need to be modified later on which is pretty bad. That's why I don't have many commits but I swear I work on the projects haha.
