## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I continued working on stat class then we've decided that we need a database first. So, I've modeled very simple database for stats that is scalable. The RoomInfo database table handles the information for each room and has the room number and other information mapped to its own id. My commits don't seem to be big changes, however, my work is mostly done through spending time thinking about how each database is designed so that we will not have to make more changes to the table which is very inefficient.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will finish up creating script that builds database and push stat class. The script will be run by any type of people who will be using our Occupancy system (We are building the system so that it is expandable to other buildings/schools). The script basically contains the information about the rooms and it is easily interchangeable. Also, I will be finishing up my stat class so that it can be later used in development.

## Anything Blocking?
