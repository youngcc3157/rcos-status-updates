## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I've worked on learning Django for our backend development as well as discussing about the system structure for the whole project. I believe we will be spliting the team into Hardware and Software. Hardware team will be mainly focus on creating hardware system that will detect when a person enters or leaves the room. They will also focus on security, accuracy, and efficiency. Security is important in a sense that we don't want student to hack our website and manipulate the display. For Software, we've decided that we will use HTTP for receiving spontaneous data from Hardware team and updating it on our website.

## This Week's Plan

> For next week, I will finish the tutorial for the Django learning and start actually building a simple project. I have not done much of Python development before so it would be difficult to learn new skillset, however, I think it will be cool to learn Django as it is a cutting-edge tech that is used in many companies from the industry.

## Anything Blocking?

> Lack of knowledge for Django and python development would be the biggest blocking element.
