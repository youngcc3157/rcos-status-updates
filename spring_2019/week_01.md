## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This past week, I've worked on learning Django for our backend development as well as discussing about the system structure for the whole project. I believe we will be spliting the team into Hardware and Software. Hardware team will be mainly focus on creating hardware system that will detect when a person enters or leaves the room. They will also focus on security, accuracy, and efficiency. Security is important in a sense that we don't want student to hack our website and manipulate the display.

## This Week's Plan

> For next week, I will finish the tutorial for the Django learning and start actually building something.

## Anything Blocking?

> Lack of knowledge for Django and python development would be the biggest blocking element.
