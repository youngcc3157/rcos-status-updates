## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I finished creating our simple database about login table for our login process. It is very simeple table with loginID and password but will be modified as our login security and more members sign up for the service. Also, I've implemented login page a bit. It is fairly simple to create a page so it should not take more than few days. I've also worked on understanding codebase that other developers wrote because we haven't really worked on commenting our code. I will be working on improving our code by commenting our code later on.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will create login page. It should be very simple as it only needs sign in and sign up section. More details needs to be discussed though. Also, I will be working on final presentation and add more slides to it. We have pretty good amount of works done and are ready to show our demo. Hardware is also imeplemented and works perfectly with our software. I will fill up more slides for the presentation and practice for presenting.
