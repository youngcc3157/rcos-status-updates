## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I've finished working on commenting most of our code. It is now more readable and understandable. It has not been pushed to the master or dev branch yet. I will review the code with other developer so that I did not make any mistake before I push it to the master. It is important to get your code reviewed by other developers so that you catch all of the mistake and also get other people's perspective before you make a huge change to the stack.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I will work on activating issue tab and make issues that are relevant to the our current project. It will include improving our front-end, creating room map image for faster performance, and etc. We will also implement the issue tab system so that we assign our selves or others for implementing features. There were instances that two of us were working on the same feature. This is where issue tab system comes in and help every developer to be on the same page.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Lack of time for working on project due to other stuff.

## Notes

> None
