## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I've worked on writing some issues for our future of developeent. There are few things that I do think we need to implement such as improvement on performance, better design, and etc. I tried to be as specific as possible and even give an example for the better solution and such. I think I am done developing for the semester so I will probably finish up writing comments and push my final update to the master.
