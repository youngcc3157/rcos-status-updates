## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> I finished creating our simple database about occupy table for our logging process. This database table is for us to keep track of last visited time for each room. It will then be used to calculate the time a student spent in a room. This is a table that will be used for stat page. The stat class is now getting implemented and will be deployed very soon. Also, we've made more progress on systematic progress with hardware team.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> For next week, I will create login page and database for this. Since RPI library is worried that our application can be abused, we will make an affort to prevent it by creating login system so that only RPI student or faculty can use the website. It will be later implemented with RPI login system, however, we will just Django's login system for security purposes.
