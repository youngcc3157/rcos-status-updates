## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I started working on creating Statistic class for taking care of all of statistic for each room. It will include how long each room has been occupied, how frequently it was occupied and etc. This is information is signifcant as we can also use it for school statistics and such. So far, I have implemented just simple structure of the class and hasn't pushed my changes yet. I also have worked on system structure design for statistic class and other classes. It is important taht we are foreseeing how our code will be implemented from early on.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> for next week (or after spring break), I will finish the general structure of statistic class and push back to development branch on FLOM. Other than things that I have mentioned above, I will be also working on brainstorming about our database system design. Like what kind of information are we storing for rooms? How are we storing Room numbers and floors? How about data for statistics? and such.
